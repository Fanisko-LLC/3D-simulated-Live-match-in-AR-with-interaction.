3D simulated Live match in AR with interaction.

 About the Project (Playcanvas, Javascript, & Three.Js):

The main purpose of this project is to launch premium items such as NFT in the AR view, and the NFT update will be delivered to us and displayed in the AR view in rich visuals. The user will be able to see the transition of the NFT from one level to another in AR perspective.

Upon entering the AR view user will get to find the NFT in a 3D Graphical view.
When the user taps the update button over the NFT, it evolves with the rich transition to level 2
This will greatly benefit gaming NFTs, and when improving the NFTs to the next level, these features will entice users.

Evaluation Criteria:
